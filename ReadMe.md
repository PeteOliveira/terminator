## The Terminator

### This is a game with an objective to find someone before your ammo runs out.
### You will lose ammo with every button you click, as you search for Sarah Connor.

#### The main idea was to set up the page with some simple buttons with simple styling. I used jQuery to add events on certain buttons that were clicked, and to also change the ammo counter that would change after each click.
#### Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. jQuery
4. @font-famly to source a new font to use.
